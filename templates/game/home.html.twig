<h1>British Twenty-One!</h1>

<p>Welcome to Twenty-One!</p>

<p>Please read the rules carefully before you begin:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Player is dealt a card and it is shown on the board.</li>
    <li>The Player can either "stick" which means that they can stay with the
    cards in their hand or they can "twist" which means they can take another one.</li>
    <li>Play continues until the Player sticks or the Player's hand goes over 21.</li>
    <li>It is then the Banker's turn.</li>
    <li>The Banker wins if they get the same as or more points than the Player</li>
    <li>The Player wins if the Banker gets more than 21 or has a higher score than the Banker.</li>
    <li>Aces are worth 1 or 11.</li>
    <li>Picture cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are worth 10 points each.</li>
</ul>
